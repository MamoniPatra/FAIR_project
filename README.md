What is FAIR Principle?

Why FAIR Principle is so important for data Now-a-days? 

1. How good is your data quality? Are you confident in your data?
2. Is your data reusable, findable, accessible, and interoperable for both computers and human beings?
3. Since the ROI was guaranteed, are data costs rising?
4. With the growing diversity of data sources, how will you handle this?
5. How are you going to manage the data explosion that is occurring exponentially?
