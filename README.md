What is FAIR Principle?

The FAIR principles represent the foundation for efficient data management by guaranteeing the data's findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. Initially developed to address data-sharing obstacles in scientific research, these principles have subsequently extended across disciplinary borders, providing important guidance for data administration in various situations.

Why FAIR Principle is so important for data Now-a-days? 

1. How good is your data quality? Are you confident in your data?
2. Is your data reusable, findable, accessible, and interoperable for both computers and human beings?
3. Since the ROI was guaranteed, are data costs rising?
4. With the growing diversity of data sources, how will you handle this?
5. How are you going to manage the data explosion that is occurring exponentially?

**Data Explosion: Managing the exponential growth of data is critical, necessitating efficient data management and accessibility.
**Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Facilitating collaborative research across disciplines by enabling seamless data sharing and integration.
**Reproducibility and Transparency: Promoting reproducibility and transparency in research findings by providing accessible and verifiable datasets.
**Data-driven Decision Making: Supporting better decision-making processes by ensuring that data is reliable, accessible, and usable.
**Regulatory Compliance: Helping organizations comply with data management and sharing regulations and standards.
**Innovation and Discovery: Unlocking new discoveries and innovations through effective access and analysis of diverse datasets.
